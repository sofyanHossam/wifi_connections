# Overview
The LocalNet Share App is an Android application that allows users to create a local network for sharing data between mobile devices over Wi-Fi. One device acts as the server, generating an IP address or QR code, and other devices can join this network by entering the IP address or scanning the QR code. Once connected, users can seamlessly share data between devices.
